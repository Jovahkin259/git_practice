# Hello Git and Github

## I have added some changes to this file in another branch

Here is a practice paragraph for markdown.

1. Here is an ordered list
2. *This text is in italic*
3. **This text will be bold**
4. **This text will be in bold & italic**_

- Here is an unordered list
- Another item
- Here is a reference @Jovahkin259

You can add inline code like so:

`const name = "Yoshi"`

You can also add a block of code:

```javascript
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        console.log("This is a cool code snippet!");
    }
```
